# Visualization of the Covid Pandemic Data in Germany

Since many visualization lack of the test data, I would like to give another perspective of the Covid data visualization.
Most of the dataset do not contains the number of conducted tests. Since no test has 100% specificity and sensitivity, it is crucial to visualize the absolute numbers with the other variables.

Visualizing the absolute numbers alone without any relations can lead to a misinterpretation and wrong perceptions.
